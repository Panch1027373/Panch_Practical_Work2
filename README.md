Practical Work 2 for Fundamentals of Computer Science in UFV.

In this website you can find information about me, about how to enter some of my classmate's websites, about my degree(there is a list of almost all the subjects that I'm going to take, the ones that don't appear are optatives, and I have not decided which to take yet. There is also another webpage only accesible through the degree page that it's the Fundamentals of Computer Science page, with a list of all the units we've seen.) and about some rockets of my choice, which are the Falcon 9 (I chose it as a result of the historic milestone that it is), the Falcon Heavy(I chose it as it is the transition model between the Falcon 9 and the Starship, which I also chose), and the Starship(because it is a very ambitius proyect, and it can, potentially, change the situation for the whole humanity.). Through this website you can also simulate to contact me, as there is a form that requires your information but, in the end, does nothing with it, as this are just HTML and CSS files, there are no JavaScript ones. This webpage follows a simple and static design as I wanted it to have a similar structure, mainly to avoid looking like the "Guernica" painting of Picasso, but also to mantain an order and a uniformed stetic.
The main problems that I had were basically CSS, as I wanted everything to be symetrical and proporcionated.
In conclussion, although it doesn't seem like much it serves its purpose alright and it isn't that ugly.
